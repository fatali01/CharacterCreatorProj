We created a character creator api that has a database of characters. all characters have features like what their abilities are etc... and users have the ability to put them on a Team as well.  
This WebApi Allows the user to:

Characters  - Create A character
            - List A Character
            - Update A Character
            - Delete A Character

Teams   - Create A Team
